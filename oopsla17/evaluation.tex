To study the effectiveness of our approach, 
we built a corpus of over 1 million lines of Fortran code from a
range of scientific computing packages: The Unified Model (UM)~\cite{um},
E3ME~\cite{RePEc:aen:journl:2006se-a12}, BLAS~\cite{blas},
Hybrid4~\cite{GBC:GBC635}, GEOS-Chem~\cite{geos-chem}, Navier (based
on \cite{griebel1997numerical}), Computational Physics
ed. 1~\cite{giordano1997computational},
ARPACK-NG~\cite{arpackng}, MUDPACK~\cite{MUD}, Cliffs~\cite{Cliffs}, and
SPECFEM3D~\cite{specfem3d}.

We first examined how frequently stencil computations occur. We parsed
\num{\overalllinesParsed} lines of Fortran code and found that \overalltickAssignPercent\%
(\num{\overalltickAssign}) of statements have a left-hand side as an
array subscript on neighbourhood indices. This supports the idea that
stencil-like computations are common in scientific code.  We then used
the inference procedure of the previous section to generate
specifications for stencils in the corpus to assess the design of the
language.
