# array-analyse

Provides a tool for analyising array programming idioms in Fortran
code, based on the CamFort static analysis tools.

# Installation

There are two binaries built by this project:
  * `array-analysis` which performs the static analysis and classification of arrays, generating a data file
  * `study` which takes a data file and performs some more coarse grained classification on the data

You can intall these via `stack`, e.g.,

    stack install

or cabal

    cabal install
