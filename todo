Implementation
 - Testing on inference
 - Parse signatures
 - Checking
 ? Code generation
 ? Investigate checking for C using ACSL
 ? might be possible to do inference using EVA

Evaluation
 - Work out what we want to report on [specs per loop?]
 - Run inference on corpus

Theory
 - Adapt multi-set model to include union-vs-product specs
 - Look at equational theory for this new distinction
 - Incorporate temporal specs into model [not yet done]
 - Complete soundness proofs

Misc.
 - Figure out where to associate temporal specs in the code

Paper
 - Fix syntax for union-vs-product
 - Write examples section
 - Describe inference/checking procedure
 - Write up evaluation
 - Related work [see PLDI paper from this year]
