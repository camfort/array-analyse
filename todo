Misc. / overall
 - Figure out where to associate temporal specs in the code
 - Decide on how to represent gather vs scatter

Implementation
 - Testing of inference
 M Infrastructure for specification comments
 M Parse signatures [including approximation]
 - Checking
 - Testing on flows analysis and temporal specs
 - Linearity checks [read once]
 - Code generation
 ? Emacs / vim integration [interactive insertion]
 
 Impementation [2] 
 ? Investigate checking for C using ACSL
 ? might be possible to do inference using EVA

Evaluation
 - Work out what we want to report on [specs per loop?]
 - Run inference on corpus

Theory
 - Adapt multi-set model to include union-vs-product specs
 - Look at equational theory for this new distinction
 - Incorporate temporal specs into model [not yet done]
 - Complete soundness proofs

Paper
 - Fix syntax for union-vs-product
 - Write examples section
 - Describe inference/checking procedure
 - Write up evaluation
 - Related work [see PLDI paper from this year]
