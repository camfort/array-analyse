  abstract={This paper reports how endogenous economic growth and technological change have been introduced into a global econometric model. It explains how further technological change might be induced by mitigation policies so as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and stabilize atmospheric concentrations. These are the first results of a structural econometric approach to modeling the global economy using the model E3MG (energy-environment-economy model of the globe), which in turn constitutes one component in the Community Integrated Assessment System (CIAS) of the UK Tyndall Centre. The model is simplified to provide a post-Keynesian view of the long-run, with an indicator of technological progress affecting each regionÕs exports and energy use. When technological progress is endogenous in this way, long-run growth in global GDP is partly explained by the model. Average permit prices and tax rates about 430 dollars/tC (1995) prices after 2050 are sufficient to stabilize atmospheric concentrations at 450ppm CO2 after 2100. They also lead to higher economic growth.},

Considering the importance of \{GPU\} applications, it is vital that the behaviour of \{GPU\} programs can be specified and proven correct formally. This paper presents a logic to verify \{GPU\} kernels written in OpenCL, a platform-independent low-level programming language. The logic can be used to prove both data-race-freedom and functional correctness of kernels. The verification is modular, based on ideas from permission-based separation logic. We present the logic and its soundness proof, and then discuss tool support and illustrate its use on a complex example kernel. "
